Use Parallel Successive Convex Approximation (PSCA) algorithm for the feature selection problem over discrete variables 

The details of PSCA algorithm can be found here: http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.3665

The details of Discrete Renyi Classifier can be found here: http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.01764

You can run the algorithm on your own data.
